1>	Make a server <router> in nodeJs. 
	Blockchain is working on guest OS on special IP.
	Router is working on Host OS on localhost and 8000 port.  

2>	Make nodes <http-clients> in nodeJs that sends data among them selves and are part of ethereum network. 
	Data is usually sensor based like light and temperature.
	These values are constanlty triggered among the nodes and the server <router>.

3>	Make network using web3 interactions in p2p fashion.
	Nodes interact with each other using web3 interactions.

4>	Use (4 Lpatops, 2 Guest OS making request to specific IP) Total 5 nodes acting as IoT Node.
	<http-clients> will open web page and send the requests. 

5>	Router will trigger mobile agent and it will move from node to node. Each node giving IP of other. 
	Mobile agent have IP of starting node. 
	On each node visit Mobile agent will analyze the IP of other unvisited node.
	After visitng all nodes, MA will come to router and give details about all the node.
	Server <router> will forward all these details to the fog.

6>	All the values are gthered and submited to router and then to fog and here the fog make transactions in blockchain.
	Fog will calculate the trsut against each node and shoot the values to the blockchain.
	Node on each sending data message will analyze the trust of the device. If the device is not trusted node will be red alerted that device.
